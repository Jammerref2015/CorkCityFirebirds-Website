# Roller Derby Website

This is a website for a local roller derby team to help promote and create public awareness by including information on the team, upcoming events, learn the basics of the sport, 
as well the ability to sign up for information regarding joining the team.
 
## UX
 

The aim of this website is to primarily to attract two types of user. The first being someone who doesn't know anything about roller derby, is interested in finding out more and is perhaps interested in joining the team. This user can view videos that give a high level overview of the sport. They can also fill in a contact form should they 
be interested in joining. 

The second type of user is someone who is just interested in following the team and is checking out if there are any events coming up, or simply want the latest news on the team. This information is present on the home page.  

Userâ€™s goals: To get information about the team; fundraising events, upcoming games, squad, news, basic information about the rules of roller derby from the official governing body.


A folder containing mockups is available in the Github page for this project.
